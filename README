# This project it´s based on  "Word Cloud" from Shiny Gallery by RStudio

The idea it´s pretty simple, this app shows a word cloud of a book that was previously selected.

Step 1: At the first combo box, choose a book from the combo´s list and press "Change"
Step 2: Choose a minimum frequency of the words and the top Nth popular words in the scroll "Maximum Number of Words"

You can check the result in cloud generated in the right part of the application screen.
